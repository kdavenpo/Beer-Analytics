# Beer-Reviews

TCB Analytics kindly provided me with this "One-Size-Fits-All Interview Kit" as a training exercise. The dataset consists of 1.5 million beer reviews from Beer Advocate and asked that it be completed in R or Python. I completed the assignment in an R Markdown document and saved it to HTML. Both files are saved in the repository. 

Following are the questions and instructions provided: 

1.	Which brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV%?
2.	If you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?
3.	Which of the factors (aroma, taste, appearance, palette) are most important in determining the overall quality of a beer?
4.	Lastly, if I typically enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?

The data can be downloaded from here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/demo-datasets/beer_reviews.tar.gz. Please document your code 
and explain the reasoning behind your answers.
